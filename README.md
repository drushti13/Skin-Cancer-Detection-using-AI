# Skin Cancer Detection Using AI

An AI-powered diagnostic web application for early skin cancer detection. Built using Python, Flask, Machine Learning, and React, the tool enables users to upload images of skin lesions and receive real-time predictions along with diagnostic confidence levels.

## Description

This project aims to assist in the early identification of skin cancer using deep learning models trained on medical imaging data. By integrating a Flask-based backend with a React frontend, the application offers a responsive and intuitive platform for both patients and healthcare professionals. The model was trained on the HAM10000 dataset and evaluated on the ISIC dataset to ensure its reliability and robustness in varied clinical scenarios.

## Key Features

- **AI-Based Skin Cancer Classification**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to analyze uploaded images and classify them based on cancer risk.
- **High Prediction Accuracy**: Achieved an approximate accuracy of 87%, providing confidence scores along with results.
- **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Trained on HAM10000 and tested against ISIC data to validate real-world performance.
- **Web Application Interface**: Developed with Flask (backend) and React (frontend) for seamless interaction and instant feedback.
- **Real-Time Image Processing**: Users can upload lesion images and receive immediate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Clean, modern UI designed for ease of use by both patients and medical staff.
- **Future Scope**:
  - Integration of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for storing diagnostic history securely.
  - Recommendation system for suggesting nearby dermatologists and treatment centers.
